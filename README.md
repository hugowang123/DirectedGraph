# DirectedGraph

This is my implementation of a directed graph in C. Each graph structure contains a dynamically allocated array of vertices, and each vertex has a list of edges along with a string representing its name. Each edge is paired with its corresponding cost.

graph.h contains the graph's method skeletons and graph-implementation.h contains the struct typedefs.
